## For Questions 1. through 3.
Set the variable name equal to your answer.

If it is a "True/False" question, keep in mind that capitalization matters.
i.e. `True` works, but `true` does not.

## Question 4.
Should be answered by defining the specified function. Name the function "main".

Optionally, you may call the function in your code, but it is not required.
