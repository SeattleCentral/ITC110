# Description from Repl.it

## Scenario

You are working as a software engineer on a team creating software for Seattle Central College. You have been assigned the task of creating a minimum viable class definition for the Student model. This will be used to test the student GPA application code. Refer to the following specifications.

## Specifications

1) Create a "Student" class.

2) Store instance variables:
first_name - String
last_name - String
grades - List

3) Create methods:
__init__(first_name - String, last_name - String) - None
name() - String
addGrade(grade - Float) - None
getGPA() - float

The three methods should have the following function signatures

    __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        # set self.first_name and self.last_name

    name(self):
        # return first_name + " " + last_name

    addGrade(self, grade):
        # add a grade (0.0 - 4.0) to self.grades

    getGPA(self):
        #return the average GPA (0.0 to 4.0)
