## Importing graphics.py
You need to import graphics.py to run the GUI exercises. The simplest way to make importing work is to place a copy of `graphics.py` in the folder you will be working out of.

The following are different methods to import functionality from the graphics.py library:

**Import module**

    import graphics
    
    # Example Usage:
    win = graphics.GraphWin()

**Import "all"**

    from graphics import *
    
    # Example Usage:
    win = GraphWin()

**Import only "what you need"**

    from graphics import GraphWin
    
    # Example Usage:
    win = GraphWin()
    
Note: you can also import select items using a comma-separated list.

    # from graphics import GraphWin, Circle, Point
