## Course Description

Intro to basic computing concepts and object oriented programming. Prereq: BTM 111 w/ 2.0 or higher and eligibility for MAT 088, or instructor permission.
 
## Course Goals

After completing this course students will understand the basic concepts of computer programming and put them in practice with Python and eventually, with other programming languages. 

#### These concepts include:
* Elements of Programs: Names, expressions
* Output Statements
* Assignment Statements
* Numeric Data Types and Computing with numbers
* Objects
* Graphics
* Sequences: Strings, Lists, Files
* Functions
* Decision Structures
* Loop Structures and Booleans
* Classes
* Object Oriented Design
* Algorithms

## Textbook (required):

Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science 3rd Ed by John Zelle

## Assignments

Weekly Assignments will be emailed by the instructor until Canvas is setup for this course. All assignments are designed to give you practice with new skills, concepts, and tools covered in class.

Your homework must be turned in on time. Late submissions may be granted partial credit when accompanied by an ingenuitive excuse. Generally speaking, students will learn more if coursework is up-to-date with the lecture. Unfortunately, assignments turned in after course end will receive 0 points. 

To receive full credit, your completed assignment should perform the required functionality and, if specified, use the techniques learned during class. Additionally, all code must meet coding style guidelines. 

Students will have 1 additional week to correct code rejected for not meeting style guidelines. 

Assignments are worth 20 points each.

## Quizzes/Exams

There will be multiple Quizzes, a Midterm, and a Final Exam.
Quizzes will normally be administered in class and may be “group efforts.”
Missing a Quiz due to absence will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, makeups will be allowed unless absences become problematic.
The Midterm and Final Exam will include multiple choice questions, short answer, writing short code snippets, and identifying errors in printed code.
Quizzes are worth 20 points each.
The Midterm and Final Exam are worth 100 points each.

## Evaluation (subject to change)

Will be based on Assignments, Quizzes, the Midterm, and the Final Exam.



## Materials

USB Drive or Cloud Storage 

## Attendance 

While regular attendance is not technically mandatory, in practice, it usually is. This is by design to mimic “real life” scenarios. Often times, showing up is the most important thing. And being present for lectures, group quizzes, and code reviews will greatly improve your grade.  

This is a programming class and you need to be prepared to work hard and to spend adequate amount of time outside of the classroom coding.   

Helping / Working with Others

I encourage you to work with other class members, which is how real life software is produced. However,  you must hand in your own assignments. If found cheating,  you will receive no credit and be subject to college disciplinary action. For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.

## Accessibility

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or having emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in Rm. 1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS you will be given a letter of accommodation that should be handed to your instructor.
